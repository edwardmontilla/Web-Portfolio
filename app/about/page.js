            <h2 className="text-lg font-semibold lnFont">So what made me pursue a career in software development?</h2>
                <p>
                I hadn't thought that I would go into software development but I was always interested in technology. 
                What inspired me to pursue a career in software development was the ability to create something from scratch and see it come to life. 
                I love the idea of creating something that can be used by others and make their lives easier. 
                While the problem-solving aspect of software development may not seem as fun at first glance, the gratification and constant learning that 
                come with it are what fuel my passion for it. I am always looking for new challenges and ways to improve my skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                In addition to my technical and artistic skills, I also enjoy spending time outdoors. I play badminton on a weekly basis and love going on hikes to explore new places. 
                Additionally, I'm an avid gamer and a huge fan of illustrations from both video games and animation. 
                I'm also planning to get back into aquascaping, creating a small underwater landscape to soothe my mind.
